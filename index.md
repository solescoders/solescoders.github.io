SOLES codeRs are a community of 'R' users, coders, and makers (or aspiring to be, anyway), based in the [School of Life and Environmental Sciences](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-life-and-environmental-sciences.html), at USyd. Run by staff and students, we enjoy catching up to share knowledge and learn new skills around R and data-wrangling/analysis more broadly, in a safe and friendly environment.

### Join us

**What do we do?** We catch up weekly during semester to either hack away at our data- and R-related problems (drop-ins) or learn/refine skills together (workshops).

**Everyone is welcome**: students (undergrad, honours, HDR, ++), academics, and researchers across all career stages, interests, and levels of experience - the more the merrier! There's no need to notify of attendance, just check the schedule, join the Slack group, and come along whenever you like.

**Is there food?** Yep! If nothing else, come for the chat & snacks!

**How do we stay in touch?** Join us on Slack, [via this invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/solescoders/signup) (for all @sydney email addresses, otherwise [email Tom](mailto:thomas.white@sydney.edu.au) for a link). [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/) is basically a chatroom, where we can easily keep in touch and share things, without the hassle of more email. All announcements and general chit-chat will be via the solescodeRs slack workspace, but you can set up email alerts for messages in there if you prefer.

**Want to contribute? Got suggestions?** If you have some experience with R or related areas and would like to be involved (e.g. by lending an ear/eye at the drop-in sessions), we'd be very glad to have you! Just [get in touch]({{ site.baseurl }}/people) for a chat anytime. Note that advanced skills and deep experience aren't required at all (we're not experts!) just some decent working knowledge and a willingness to lend your brain to new problems.

Also if you have suggestions for skills you'd like to develop, or people you'd like to hear from, we'd be similarly glad to hear it. This is a new endeavour so feedback, thoughts, and suggestions are most welcome as we continue to find out way.
