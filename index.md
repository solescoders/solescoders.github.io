title: An R coding and data-hassling community in USyd's School of Life and Environmental Sciences
---

### Welcome!

SOLES codeRs are a community of 'R' users, coders, and makers (or aspiring to be, anyway). Run by staff and students, we enjoy catching up to share knowledge and learn new skills around R, data-wrangling, and analysis, in a safe and friendly environment. 

### Join us

**What do we do?**

**Everyone is welcome**: students (undergrad, honours, HDR, ++), academics, and researchers across all career stages, interests, and levels of experience - the more the merrier. There's no need to 

**Want to contribute?** If you have R as a regular (or semi-regular) hac We'd be grateful to hear from you, and any expertise that you might.

### Schedule (2023 - S2)

We catch up for ca. **one hour** each week during semester, at **location TBC**. We alternate between BYO drop-in sessions for , and slightly more structured (but still very informal) workshops where we try to learn something new or dust off existing knowledge & skills. All sessions are very informal, and as much as anything are an opportunity to touch base, enjoy a snack, and hear more about all the cool work happening in the school.
