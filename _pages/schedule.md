We catch up for ~one hour each week during semester, at **time TBC** in **location TBC**. We alternate between **drop-ins/hackathons**, which are opportunities to BYO data and code to work on, and ask the brains-trust for a hand on sticky problems. And **workshops**, in which we learn something new or polish existing knowledge & skills. All sessions are very informal, and as much as anything are an opportunity to touch base, enjoy a snack, and hear more about all the cool science and teaching which takes place in the school.
