We catch up for ~90 minutes each fortnight during semester, at **time TBC** in **location TBC**. Around ~40 minutes is spent on a presentation & chat on an R-related (or adjacent) topic, with the remainder given to honing our new skills or otherwise bringing your own data/problems to work on and ask for a hand if needed. All sessions are very informal, and as much as anything are an opportunity to touch base, enjoy a snack, and hear more about all the cool science and teaching which takes place in the school.
